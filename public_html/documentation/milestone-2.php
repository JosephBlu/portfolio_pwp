		<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
	<!-- Web page format for the wire frame -->
		<h2>Portfolio Wireframe</h2>
			<p>
				The portfolio web page is going to feature a single static page. Each page, on both the mobile and the web page, I want each page to be minimal and direct with the content that I want to present to the to the viewer.
			</p>
		<!-- these following images are the wireframe for the web and mobile page for the portfolio-->
		<h2>Web Page Wire Frame</h2>

		<img src="images/deviceFormat/homepageDv.png" alt="homepageDv" width="250" height="400">
		<p>
			On the homepage, I will have a brief about section, an introduction explaining about what they are going to see in the upcoming pages. The navigation bar, the bar will be present through-out the scrolling of the page to give the viewer easy access to help them get around the page. I believe the nav bar will be useful as I slowly start to build my portfolio.

		<p>
			On the project page, there will be a display of my past and current projects that I have either collaborated or individually created. Next to the images will be a brief description of what the projects are about and what i used to create the projects. However, on the mobile site, to prevent from clustering the screen, I have created a individual page for each project.
