## Milestone 1 Feedback
Very nice work here - your Purpose/Audience/Goals and Persona and Use Case are all clearly defined and well thought out. This will provide you with a good guide as you begin the design phase of your project in Milestone 2.

Your directory structure is set up properly, and your HTML looks very good. Only a couple of very minor pointers in Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Looking forward to seeing your design ideas in Milestone 2. Nice work - your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). You're clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Watch your HTML indentation - it's a little off. For example, the `<p>` elements are not children of the `<h3>` elements, so they shouldn't be indented afterwards.
- Very minor - but for English, the `lang` attribute should be set to `en`, not "eng".

## Milestone 2a
I like your content strategy. A mininmal design is smart as long as you use the space well and keep it aesthetically pleasing with the content you DO include. Make sure to think about the design as you develop the site.

I really enjoy your nav bar placement. It's not common to see a nav menu located somewhere else than the top of the page. It may be more difficult to implement this type of nav bar, especially if you use it with anchor tags so the user can scroll through the page. This may be the last thing you focus on. I suggest you make sure to get all the content and styling you want out of the site, and THEN work on your navbar idea. You also want to make sure the navigation bar doesn't block out the content of the site. 

Here's a suggestion: You could use this navbar design with the floating links at the very top of the site, but when the user scrolls past a certain point, change the navbar to a standard navbar located at the top of the page. This is not hard to do with JavaScript, and it will still look very cool. Plus, it'll cut down on content being blocked by buttons.

On mobile, I would suggest avoiding the floating navbar completely. The menu is placed directly in the middle of the common "scroll zone." The user may accidently click links while simply trying to scroll through the site. That would be very annoying.




I like the design for the desktop page of Projects. On mobile, however, I think that moving each project to its own page would be a waste of space. You could use media queries and simply make them smaller on mobile devices, so it still looks good. Consider some other ideas, and ask me if you want to know more possibilities for the projects section on mobile.


Great idea for the software page. Use code snippets, and coding language logos. Your contact page will use a contact form that we help you build and embed during class, so that shouldn't be an issue.

I would also consider including things such as a downloadable resume and social media links somewhere on the site. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward. http://fontawesome.io/

You may also want to look into things such as image sliders for things like your projects showcase. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the Flickity Slider, the Owl Carosel or Slick. These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

### Nice work here. Your milestone 2a passed in Tier IV

You've got a lot of work ahead of you to catch up, but this can be done with a good plan and ~6 very focused and productive hours. Get HTML and form up by Thursday AM. Detailed notes from our meeting sent via Slack. Your Milestone 2b passes at Tier I. I'll bump it to Tier II if you can get the HTML and form up by Thursday.
