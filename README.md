## Milestone 1 Feedback
Very nice work here - your Purpose/Audience/Goals and Persona and Use Case are all clearly defined and well thought out. This will provide you with a good guide as you begin the design phase of your project in Milestone 2.

Your directory structure is set up properly, and your HTML looks very good. Only a couple of very minor pointers in Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Looking forward to seeing your design ideas in Milestone 2. Nice work - your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). You're clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Watch your HTML indentation - it's a little off. For example, the `<p>` elements are not children of the `<h3>` elements, so they shouldn't be indented afterwards.
- Very minor - but for English, the `lang` attribute should be set to `en`, not "eng".
